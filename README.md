Host-Behavior-Analysis
"Host-Behavior-Analysis" is a project focused on the analysis of property listings for a property rental company. The dataset provided has the information regarding the 2 cities in Canada, Greece, Italy, China and US each. The thorough analysis of the property listings is being done for the data and the meaningful insights have been provided, to comprehend how host behavior varies across a variety of metrics. Also extensive charts have been created to visualize the data in the best possible way.


## Problem Statement
The problem is to conduct a behavioral analysis of hosts for a property rental company to gain insights on the variation of host behavior across different metrics and identify areas for improvement.
## Insights
1.Response rate: -super hosts surpass the overall average 
response rate, with 98.31% compare to regular hosts
having avg rate is 90.75%, highlighting super hosts the commitment to exceptional service.

2.Acceptance rate: - 84% of super hosts surpass the overall average acceptance rate, but only 53% regular hosts
surpass avg.

3.Instant booking: - super hosts have a higher instant booking rate (54%) than regular hosts (39%), leading to
higher satisfaction, occupancy rates, repeat bookings, and success.

4.Identity verified: - super hosts have a higher verified profile rate (91%) than regular hosts (82%), indicating
a greater commitment to guest security and trust.
